In this project I want to Bechmark Models and optimize them on multiple hardwares
The first Model I'll be trying is the yolov12n (mainly since it contains many primitive ops i want to try to benchmark and optimize , conv matmul , many activations and resizing and reshaping and contains also an attention layer)

the hardwares I'll be testing on are these , in this order:
digital ocean VM featuring an intel Xeon 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of RAM and good amount of SSD , ubuntu 25.x OS
avnet ultra96v2 board 
Jetson Nano developer kit with 2GB VRAM GPU

what i wanna do first is make a setup.sh file and put it in the github repo that would make it work regardless of which platform (of the mentioned 3)
it is deployed on, i want the highlevel to be correct for all the 3 platforms , but i want to be especially correct and working for the digital ocean's VM , sicne i'll be using it first , the rest I'll fix iteratively
so what i want is to once i get into the terminal of each machine and git clone my repo, setup.sh installs all the required dependencies ( from libraries and runtimes to git lfs my onnx models to testing for ) and makes the environment suitable and perfect for running tests to see if the hardware is working correctly to printing hardware specifications .....
but i want u to start iteratively , just put placeholders in the avnet and the jetson part.
my models are in onnx format and i'll be using onnx cpp api and onnxruntime of cpp , it needs to be installed depending on the hardware too
so make a setup.sh -hw {hardware type} argument in the cli

here's a normal cpu code that works on my machine

here's my repo structure:
